Homework 4 Answer Sheet


1. No. A counter example is as follows. A diagram of the same has been included on subversion.
	Eg.
	Let there be 4 events M1, M2, M3, M4 and 2 processes P1, and P2.
	Now M1->M4, M1->M2, M2->M3
	Let M1 and M4 be broadcast messages from P1
	Let M2 and M3 be broadcast messages from P2
	Thus, on drawing the diagram, we see that we can get one case where P1 will get messages in the order M2, M1, M3, M4.
	We have achieved FIFO and total-ordering here but not causal ordering. 

2. No. A counter example is as follows. A diagram of the same has been included on subversion.
	Eg. This example has been taken from the lecture slides. 


3. (a) 
3. (b)

4. f -> (2, 4, 2)
   g -> (0, 2, 1)
 

5. (a) false
	It should be x->y if and only if V(x)<V(y)
5. (b) true
	Since the time stamps have two different values, they are concurrent.
